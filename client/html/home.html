			<h2> This is the project of Dimitar Nikolov and Emil Doychinov from 11b for IMCS. (Integrated MicroComputer Systems) </h2>		
			<h3> The purpose of this project is to create an effective and easy to use device that could remind people about their everyday needs. </h3> <br>

			<h2> How to set up your device </h2>	
			<h4> First, you need to create your account in the website. Then you need to set up your device and connect it to your phone via bluetooth, you need 
				to send the following commands through the bluetooth terminal: </h4>
			<ul>
				<li> ssid < wifi-name > - this saves your local WiFi network's SSID to the device </li>
				<li> pass < wifi-password > - this saves your local WiFi network's password to the device </li>
				<li> user < account-name > - this saves your account name to the device </li>
			</ul> <br>

			<h2> How to use </h2>	
			<h4> Once you have set up your account and device, you need to sign into the website and you can start working. If you want to add a reminder, press the  
				green circle, which will take you to the new reminder page. Then after you create your remider, the system will update your notification list and once 
				the time come you will be reminded by the device. </h4> <br>
